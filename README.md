# Balancer-Robot
## Introduction
The Balancer Robot was my project for the "Berufsmaturit√§tsarbeit" (BMA). The goal of this project was to design a self-balancing two wheeled robot. 
## Note
The project was quite a bit of a challenge, as I hadn't had much knowledge about control systems or desinging the mechanical system. However after many tries, the robot balanced itself quite good. This can be seen in the [BalancerRobot.mp4](/Balancer%20Robot.mp4) video.
